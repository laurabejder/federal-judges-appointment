        Senate confirmations of circuit court judges have become more politically divided
      </h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        The past 20 years, the Senate has moved from a broad bipartisan consensus on most confirmations of federal circuit judges to now confirming judges on slim partisan majorities.
      </p>

        <p><i>By Laura Bejder</i></p>
        <p>When Edward G. Prado in 2003 was confirmed as a US circuit judge of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, 97 out of 100 senators across party lines voted to confirm the judge.</p>
        <p>15 years later, when his successor was appointed, the picture had changed. The new judge, Andrew S. Oldham was confirmed on a narrow all-republican majority of 50 yea votes against 49 democratic and independent nay votes. </p>
        <p>This is not as much an expression of different candidate popularity as an example of a development towards a more politically divided Senate on the confirmation of federal judges.</p>
        <p>From 2001 and up until the 115th congress, the first under the presidency of Donald Trump, was convened in January 2017, the average numbers of yea votes to confirm judges for each congress swung between 80 and 91. Since then the number has dropped â€“ first to 61 during the 115th congress and latest only an average 51 yea votes throughout the 117th congress that ended in December 2022.</p>
